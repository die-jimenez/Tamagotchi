**Tamagotchi Simulator (Hardware + Game)** is a personal project developed in 2025. Built entirely from scratch, it combines both software and physical hardware to recreate the experience of a virtual pet device.  
Written in **C++** for microcontrollers, the project includes custom-built architecture for animations, state management, and event handling — all designed to replicate systems similar to **DOTween**.
